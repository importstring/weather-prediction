WeatherAI Script

This script handles the ingestion, preprocessing, and modeling of weather and space event data.
It continuously monitors specified directories for new or modified CSV files, processes the data,
trains a machine learning model, and makes predictions based on the updated data.
It also includes functionalities for generating forecasts, evaluating model accuracy, and updating the model incrementally.

The code got really messy and I don't have permissions to share the data so I wrote an article:
